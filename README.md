# AppiumProject
This repository contains clinic management (appointment scheduling majorly) application that we developed for Mobile Computing's term project in 6th semester. 
We've configured Appium with android studio and now we're adding test cases for the application. To check out test cases navigate to AppiumProject/ClinicAdmin/app/src/test/java/umucom/android/clinic_admin/ and you'll find a file named Testsuite.java
